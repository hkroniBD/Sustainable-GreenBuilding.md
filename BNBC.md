# ⚡ BNBC: Electrical-Related Contents (Comprehensive Summary)

BNBC organizes electrical requirements into chapters covering **design principles, equipment standards, installation rules, safety provisions, and coordination with fire, mechanical, and architectural systems**.

Each section combines technical requirements with legal enforceability.

---

## 🔌 1. General Electrical Principles

BNBC begins by defining the purpose of electrical rules.

### Key Points

* Scope of electrical installations
* Definitions of electrical terms (circuit, grounding, feeder, short-circuit level)
* Minimum safety criteria
* Types of electrical systems allowed in buildings

### Physical Significance

BNBC ensures that electricity is delivered without causing excessive heat, shock hazards, or fire.
It uses fundamental relations such as:

`Power = Voltage × Current`

These values are used to size circuits, cables, and safety devices correctly.

---

## 🧵 2. Wiring Methods & Materials

BNBC details accepted practices for distributing electricity within buildings.

### Covered Topics

* Conductor types and conductor sizes
* Cable insulation classes
* Conduit, trunking, cable tray installation
* Concealed vs surface wiring rules
* Color codes for wiring
* Maximum number of wires in a conduit

### Practical Meaning

Architectural walls, ceilings, and shafts must be designed with enough space for safe cable routing.

---

## 🔐 3. Earthing & Grounding Requirements

Earthing is one of the most safety-critical topics in BNBC.

### BNBC Discusses

* Earthing conductor sizes
* Earthing electrode types (pipes, plates, rods)
* Resistance requirements
* Equipment grounding vs system grounding
* Bonding of metallic parts
* Earthing pit design guidelines

### Why Important

Earthing provides a low-resistance path for fault current, preventing shock and reducing the risk of fire.

---

## 🔥 4. Protection Against Overcurrent, Short-Circuit, and Shock

BNBC provides selection rules for protection equipment.

### Includes

* MCB, MCCB, fuse ratings
* Short-circuit calculation basics
* RCD/RCCB requirements
* Arc fault protection
* Isolation and switching rules

### Engineering Meaning

Protection devices must clear faults faster than the cable reaches dangerous temperatures.

A simple concept behind these rules:
`Fault Current = Voltage / Fault Impedance`

BNBC ensures protection devices operate within safe margins.

---

## 💡 5. Lighting Systems

BNBC regulates both normal and emergency lighting.

### Covers

* Lux level requirements for different spaces
* Energy efficiency requirements
* Lighting control systems
* Placement rules for emergency luminaires
* Exit signage illumination

### Example

A classroom might require illumination above a minimum lux value to ensure visual comfort.

---

## 🏛️ 6. Power Distribution & Panel Boards

BNBC provides guidance on how electricity should flow through a building.

### Includes

* Service entrance rules
* Metering systems
* Feeder sizing
* Distribution boards (DB) clearance and accessibility
* Transformer room requirements
* Generator rooms and ventilation
* Busbar sizing and mounting

### Physical Significance

Voltage drop must remain within permitted limits:

`Voltage Drop = Current × Cable Resistance × Length`

BNBC defines maximum allowable percentages for lighting and power circuits.

---

## 🚒 7. Fire Safety & Electrical Systems

BNBC integrates electrical design with fire protection.

### Topics

* Fire-rated cabling requirements
* Power supply to fire pumps and smoke fans
* Emergency power distribution
* Fire alarm system wiring
* Separation of normal and emergency circuits
* Flame-retardant materials for wiring

### Reason

During fire events, critical electrical systems must remain operational to support safe evacuation.

---

## 🌀 8. HVAC & Mechanical Electrical Interface

BNBC governs electrical supply to mechanical systems.

### Includes

* Motor protection
* Starter types
* Cable sizing for HVAC loads
* Electrical rooms for chillers and AHUs

### Example

Motors require high starting current. BNBC ensures breakers and cables are selected accordingly.

---

## 🌐 9. Special Occupancy Requirements

Certain buildings need additional electrical provisions.

### Discussed For

* Hospitals
* Theaters and auditoriums
* Hazardous locations
* Industrial buildings
* High-rise buildings

### Example

High-rise buildings require dedicated fireman switches, emergency risers, and backup generator circuits.

---

## 🏗️ 10. Testing, Inspection & Commissioning

BNBC mandates testing before energizing a building.

### Tests Include

* Continuity test
* Insulation resistance test
* Earth resistance measurement
* Polarity test
* Functional test of protective devices

### Why

Testing ensures the installation matches design values and safety rules.

---

## 📡 11. ELV (Extra-Low Voltage) Systems

BNBC covers communication and control systems too.

### Includes

* Telephone and data cabling
* CCTV
* PA system
* MATV / CATV
* Access control
* Fire alarm systems

### Architecture Link

Low-voltage systems require space for conduits, server racks, risers, and access points.
