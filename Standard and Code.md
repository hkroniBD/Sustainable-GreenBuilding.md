## ⚡ Definition of *Standard* and *Code*

### **📘 Standard**

A **standard** is a formally approved technical guideline that specifies *how electrical materials, equipment, and systems should be designed, tested, and measured*.
It provides **best practices**, engineering rules, and performance criteria.

A standard tells you *the correct way to do something*.
Examples include:

* Cable insulation standards
* Breaker performance standards
* Earthing conductor specifications

A standard is usually **not legally binding** on its own, but it becomes binding if a government adopts it.

A simple use case:
When a standard defines cable capacity, it uses equations such as:

`Allowable current capacity = f(conductor area, insulation type, temperature)`

This ensures safe cable heating limits.

### **📕 Code**

A **code** is a legally enforceable document that governs the *installation* and *application* of electrical systems inside buildings.
While a standard describes **how something should be designed**, a code dictates **what must be done** to comply with law.

A code covers:

* Wiring rules
* Safety requirements
* Installation procedures
* Protection methods
* Inspection and testing requirements

Building codes reflect:

* National safety policies
* Fire protection rules
* Environmental conditions
* Utility regulations

A code is enforceable by:

* Government authorities
* Safety inspectors
* Building approval committees

Example:
A code may require a building to have:

* Two separate circuits for emergency lighting
* A minimum conductor size
* Mandatory earthing resistance less than a threshold value

## 🌍 What Are Electrical Standards or Codes for Buildings?

Electrical standards and codes ensure safe, reliable, and efficient design of building electrical systems.
They prevent hazards like:

* Electric shock
* Circuit overheating
* Fire due to short circuits
* Voltage drops
* Equipment failure

They ensure that equations such as:

`Power (W) = Voltage (V) × Current (A)`

are correctly used while sizing components.

These documents define:

* Cable routing practices
* Earthing and bonding methods
* Breaker and fuse selection
* Overcurrent protection
* Load balancing
* Lighting and power distribution rules
* Testing and commissioning steps

## 🧪 Real-World Example

You design an office with a load of **25,000 W** at **230 V**.

Current needed:
`I = 25000 / 230 ≈ 108.7 A`

A standard (such as IEC 60364 cable tables) tells you **what conductor size can carry 109 A safely**.

A code (such as BNBC or NEC) tells you:

* The minimum breaker rating
* The required earthing method
* Cable installation method
* Maximum allowable voltage drop

Standards ensure correct sizing;
Codes ensure legal and safe installation.
